# Design Patterns

These patterns are not algorithms or specific implementations. They are more like ideas, opinions, and abstractions that can be useful in certain situations to solve a particular kind of problem.

The specific implementation of the patterns may vary depending on many different factors. But what's important is the concepts behind them, and how they might help us achieve a better solution for our problem.

## Types of Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Design Patterns
    This design pattern relates to the fact how objects are created in memory.
### 2. Structural Design Patterns
### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
